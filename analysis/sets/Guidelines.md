1. Tempo (BPM)
Interpretation:

A steady tempo indicates a consistent rhythm, which can be used to maintain a dance floor's energy.
Fluctuations in tempo might indicate transitions between tracks or deliberate tempo changes to increase or decrease the energy.
Sudden drops might signify breakdowns or bridges in tracks, while sudden increases can indicate build-ups.

2. Energy (RMS)
Interpretation:

Higher energy levels usually correlate with louder, more intense sections of a track, like choruses or climaxes.
Lower energy levels can signify quieter parts, like intros, breakdowns, or outros.
Rapid changes in energy can indicate transitions between tracks.

3. Key
Interpretation:

The key provides information about the tonal center of the music.
Transitions between keys need to be handled carefully. If not executed well, they can sound jarring. Harmonic mixing techniques often utilize key information to make smoother transitions.
A change in key can rejuvenate a DJ set or provide contrast between tracks.


4. Spectral Centroid
Interpretation:

Represents the "center of mass" of the spectrum.
Higher values can indicate a "brighter" or "sharper" sound, which might be perceived as more treble-heavy.
Lower values suggest a "duller" or "muddier" sound, indicating more bass or mid frequencies.


5. Spectral Bandwidth
Interpretation:

Provides insights into the timbral texture of the audio.
Higher bandwidths suggest a noisier sound, while lower values might indicate a more tonal sound.


6. Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)
Interpretation:

Measures the amount of harmonicity in a signal.
Higher HNR values indicate a cleaner, more harmonic sound, like vocals or melodic instruments.
Lower HNR values suggest a noisier segment, which might be effects, percussions, or distorted sounds.

7. Zero-Crossing Rate
Interpretation:

Indicates the rate at which a signal changes polarity.
Higher rates can be indicative of percussive or rhythmic elements.
Lower rates might indicate more sustained sounds or quieter sections.
