# Beat Tracking 

## What are Beats in Music?
Imagine you're at a magical dance party with your friends. As the music plays, you feel a strong pulse that makes you tap your feet and move to the rhythm. These pulses are called beats, and they form the heart and soul of music!

Beats are like the heartbeat of a song. They're the regular pulses that keep everything in sync and make us want to dance and sing along. In techno music, beats are especially important, as they provide the driving force that keeps the party going!

##  What is Beat Tracking?
Beat Tracking is like having a magical dance partner who can move with you perfectly. It's a special ability of our music machine to identify the beats in a song and tell us the exact moments when we should tap our feet and sway to the music!

Just like when you count 1, 2, 3, 4 to dance in time, the music machine can count the beats in the music and let us know when the magical moments of the song's rhythm occur.

## Why is Beat Tracking Important?
Beat Tracking is essential for magical DJs, producers, and musicians. It allows us to synchronize our music with a desired tempo and maintain a consistent rhythm throughout our mixes and performances. For example, if we want to play a song at 120 beats per minute (BPM), we can use Beat Tracking to make sure the song is playing at the right speed. This is especially important when we're mixing two songs together, as we want to make sure they're both playing at the same tempo. 

With Beat Tracking, we can smoothly transition from one song to another, creating a seamless flow of magical music that keeps the dance floor alive! It's like having a magical metronome that guides us and keeps us in sync with the rhythm of the world.

## How Does Beat Tracking Work?
Beat Tracking is a complex process that involves analyzing the sound waves of a song and identifying the moments when the beats occur. Some of the mathematical techniques include calculating the tempo, finding the onset of each beat, and estimating the beat period. 

### Tempo
Tempo is the speed of the music, measured in beats per minute (BPM). It's like the speed of a magical train that carries us through the song. The tempo of a song is usually constant, but it can change over time. For example, the tempo of a song might start at 120 BPM and gradually increase to 140 BPM. 

### Onset Detection
Onset detection is the process of identifying the moments when the beats occur. It's like having a magical detector that can sense the beats in the music. Onset detection is a challenging task because the beats are not always clearly defined. For example, a drum beat might be loud and easy to detect, but a bass beat might be soft and difficult to detect. 


## Algorithms and Machine Learning for Beat Tracking
The current available beat tracking methods are:
    - Dynamic Programming Beat Tracking (DPBT)
    DPBT is a classic beat tracking algorithm that uses dynamic programming to find the optimal beat sequence. It is a robust and reliable method that can handle tempo variations and noisy signals. However, it is computationally expensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications.

    - Recurrent Neural Network Beat Tracking (RNNBT)
        RNNBT is a deep learning-based beat tracking algorithm that uses a recurrent neural network to predict the beat locations. It is a fast and efficient method that can handle tempo variations and noisy signals. RNNBT is publicly available at [madmom](https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom)
