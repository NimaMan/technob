# Module - Overview
Before we dive into the details of the technob module, let's take a step back and look at the big picture. In this tutorial, we'll explore the connection between music and computation and how we can use this connection to create our own magical music! üéµüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüé∂

## Why is Music Connected to Computation and Math?

Imagine music as a magical language that can express feelings, stories, and adventures without using any words. When musicians play their instruments or sing, they create beautiful melodies and rhythms that touch our hearts and make us dance with joy.

Now, think of computers as super-smart friends who can do lots of calculations really fast. They can help us understand music in a different way and even create new magical sounds!

You see, music is made up of special codes called "notes." Each note has a secret number that tells us its pitch or how high or low it sounds. Just like when we count 1, 2, 3, 4, computers can count these notes too, and they can remember the order of the notes to play them back exactly the same way every time.

Computers also know how to measure time, just like a clock. They can tell us how long a note lasts, like when we clap for 1 second or 2 seconds. With this time magic, computers can make sure all the notes in a song play at the right time, like a perfect dance party where everyone moves in sync!

But wait, there's more! Music is not just about sounds; it's also about different colors and flavors of sound. Computers can listen to music and understand the colors and flavors too. They can tell us if the music is loud or soft, fast or slow, happy or sad, just like a magical music taste tester!

Now, here comes the super fun part! Computers can help musicians create new sounds that no one has heard before. They do this by mixing and matching the secret numbers of notes, trying out different combinations, and making musical magic with math!

So, music and computation are best friends because they work together to understand, play, and create all the amazing sounds we love. With their magical teamwork, musicians can compose beautiful songs, and computers can help us enjoy and explore the incredible world of music! üéµüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüé∂


But how can we use this magic to create our techno music? Let's find out in our upcoming segments:

01_overview.md:
In this section, we'll introduce you to our exciting project called Technob - the audio processing module for techno music production. We'll explain the objectives of this project and give you an overview of the entire audio processing pipeline. Don't worry; we'll keep it simple and easy to understand!

02_segmentation.md:
Now, in this tutorial, we'll teach you what segmentation means in the world of audio processing. It's like breaking a big puzzle into smaller pieces, making it easier to understand and work with. We'll show you some cool code examples and pictures to help you see how it all works. By segmenting the music, we'll be able to focus on specific parts, such as intros, breakdowns, and drops, for precise modifications and transitions.

03_pitch_tracking.md:
Remember how each note in music has a special number? In this tutorial, you'll learn how to find those numbers from an audio file, just like a musical detective. We call this "pitch tracking," and it helps us understand the melody and harmonies of the music. We'll use some fantastic Python code to show you how to do it yourself!

04_sample_separation.md:
Now, get ready to become a musical wizard! In this tutorial, we'll use some magical code with the "librosa" library to separate the cool beats and the magical melodies in a song. This technique is called "sample separation," and it allows us to apply distinct processing to drums and synths, making our techno music sound even cooler.

05_beat_tracking.md:
In this tutorial, you'll become the captain of the rhythm team! You'll learn how to find and dance to the beats of a song. We call this "beat tracking," and it helps us maintain the desired tempo and groove throughout our mix. We'll use some Python code to make the music machine synchronize with the desired tempo and create a consistent beat throughout your mix.

06_feature_extraction.md:
Now, we'll show you how to uncover hidden treasures of music with more numbers and math! We'll extract special features like intensity, pitch, timbre, and volume. These features provide valuable insights into the characteristics of your audio and assist you in crafting the desired sound. We'll use some Python magic with "librosa" and "scipy" to extract these features from an audio file.

07_quantization.md:
Imagine making all the beats in your music play in perfect harmony, like a team of synchronized dancers! That's what quantization does. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use some Python magic with "pyrubberband" to align the audio to a specific tempo or beat grid. This ensures that all elements of your techno music are precisely timed and synchronized, creating a tight and professional sound.

08_source_separation.md:
In this final tutorial, you'll use the pre-trained DNN (don't worry, we'll explain what that means!) to separate different sounds in a song. It's like creating a magic potion of music! We call this "source separation," and it helps us isolate and enhance individual elements, such as vocals or instruments, independently. We'll introduce you to some fascinating deep learning-based source separation algorithms that use the power of computation to make your techno music shine!

So get ready to embark on this exciting journey into the world of music and computation, where you'll become a music magician and create your own magical techno music! üé∂üîÆ‚ú®
