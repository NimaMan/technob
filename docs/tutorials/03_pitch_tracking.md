# Pitch Tracking

## What is pitch?

Pitch is how high or low a musical note sounds. When musicians play notes on instruments, each note has a specific pitch. On a piano, lower pitched notes are on the left and higher pitched notes are on the right. Pitch is measured in Hz (Hertz) which represents the frequency or vibrations per second of the sound wave.

## What is Pitch Tracking?
Imagine you have a magical flute that can play all sorts of sounds. When you blow into the flute, it creates different musical notes, like the sounds of birds singing or bells ringing. Each note has a special magical number that tells us how high or low it sounds. Pitch tracking is like listening to the flute and figuring out these magical numbers to know which notes are being played.


## Why is Pitch Tracking Important?
Pitch tracking helps us understand the melody of a song - the beautiful tune that makes us hum along or dance with joy! Just like in a magical story, the melody is like the main character, guiding us through the adventure of the music.

By knowing the magical numbers of the notes, we can play along with the melody, create new musical layers, or even make the magical music machine sing like a human!

## How Does Pitch Tracking Work?
Now, this is where some really cool magic comes into play! Our magical music machine can listen to a song and analyze the sounds just like a musical detective. It looks for the special patterns in the sound waves that reveal the magical numbers of the notes.
