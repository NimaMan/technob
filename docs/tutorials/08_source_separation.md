# Source Separation


## What is Source Separation?
Imagine you are in a magical forest, surrounded by a symphony of sounds. Birds chirping, leaves rustling, and magical creatures playing their melodic tunes. Source Separation is your magical ability to focus on one sound at a time and understand the unique melody of each magical creature!

In the magical language of music, Source Separation is the art of isolating and separating different sound sources within a mixed audio recording. Just like a skilled magician who can identify and highlight each element of a magic trick, Source Separation allows us to unmask and enhance individual sound elements.

## Why is Source Separation Important?
Source Separation holds the key to unlocking the full potential of our magical compositions. In a mixed audio recording, different sound sources, like vocals, instruments, and percussions, come together to create a beautiful tapestry of sound. With Source Separation, we can isolate and manipulate these elements, adding new layers of magic to our music.

Imagine a magical painting with multiple layers of colors. By separating each color, we can adjust and enhance them individually, creating a masterpiece of vibrant hues. Similarly, Source Separation empowers us to modify and enhance individual sound sources, making our music more captivating and immersive!

Some of the most popular methods include: 
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
NMF is a classic source separation algorithm that decomposes the mixed audio signal into a set of basis vectors and activation coefficients. The basis vectors represent the spectral characteristics of the sources, while the activation coefficients represent the temporal characteristics. NMF is a simple and effective method that can handle multiple sources. However, it may be computationally expensive. 

- Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
ICA is a classic source separation algorithm that decomposes the mixed audio signal into a set of independent components. The components represent the individual sources, and they are statistically independent of each other. ICA is a simple and effective method that can handle multiple sources. However, it may be computationally expensive.

- Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
DNN is a deep learning-based source separation algorithm that uses a deep neural network to separate the sources. Using deep learning to solve this problem has become increasingly popular in recent years. DNN is a fast and efficient method that can handle multiple sources. Some of the most popular DNN-based source separation algorithms include: 
    - Deep Clustering (DC)
    - Deep Attractor Network (DANet)
    - Permutation Invariant Training (PIT)
    - Wave-U-Net
