# Sample Separation

# What is Sample Separation?

Imagine you are listening to your favorite magical song with your eyes closed. As the music plays, you hear the sounds of a magical drum beating, bells ringing, and a mesmerizing melody from a magical flute. Each of these sounds is like a magical ingredient that comes together to create the music you love.

Sample Separation is like using a special magical filter to isolate these individual sounds. It's like taking each magical ingredient and revealing its unique taste, color, and texture. By doing this, we can control each sound independently and create new musical potions with our imagination!

# Why is Sample Separation Important?

Sample Separation gives us the power to modify and enhance each magical sound separately. Just like a chef uses different ingredients to make a delicious dish, musicians use separate sounds to create beautiful harmonies and catchy beats.

With Sample Separation, we can make the magical drums sound more powerful, the bells more sparkly, and the flute more enchanting! It's like having a magical mixer that lets us adjust the volume and effects of each sound to create the perfect musical potion.

# How Does Sample Separation Work?
Sample separation determines which parts of the sound belong to individual instruments and which parts belong to the rhythm. 
One way to achieve this magic is by using the "librosa" library once again. We'll use a technique called Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) to isolate the magical instruments (harmonic) from the rhythmic elements (percussive).
