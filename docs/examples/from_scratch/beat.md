# What is Beat 
In this tutorial, we dive deep into the world of beats and explore how they can be used to create magical music. We'll learn about the different types of beats, how they're used in music, and how we can use them to create our own magical songs.

Beat is a term used to describe the rhythmic pulse of music. It's like the heartbeat of a song, and it's what makes us want to dance and sing along. Beats are usually measured in beats per minute (BPM), which is the number of beats that occur in one minute. For example, a song with a BPM of 120 would have 120 beats per minute. 

## Tempo vs Beat 
Tempo is the speed of the music, measured in beats per minute (BPM). It's like the speed of a magical train that carries us through the song. The tempo of a song is usually constant, but it can change over time. For example, the tempo of a song might start at 120 BPM and gradually increase to 140 BPM.
